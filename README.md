# Weather_File_Data_Analysis
A static file with the University of Victoria's weather data, analysed.
These three files organise the file's data. The first finds the minimum and maximum temperatures of each day,
the second finds the daily average, and the final of the files will find the extreme temperatures of each recording station.
